# Contracts â€” Visual Themes

This feature does not introduce any network API endpoints.

All interactions are client-only UI events and state changes:
- Theme toggle (light/dark)
- Left pane toggle (show/hide)
- Mobile layout adaptation (responsive)
- Bubble role styling and timestamp reveal (hover/focus/tap)

No OpenAPI/GraphQL definitions are required for this feature.
