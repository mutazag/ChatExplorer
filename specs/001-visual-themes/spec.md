# Feature Specification: Visual Themes Enhancements

**Feature Branch**: `001-visual-themes`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Visual Themes enhancements: add dark and light mode with a toggle switch, add the ability to hide and show the left pane, by default it is shown, when size is being viewed in a mobile device, optimise the display of the chat list to allow more real estate for the conversation history view, and lastly add styling to the conversation view to visually separate user messages from assistant messages, user messages are aligned to the right and assistant is aligned to the left, user has a human icon next to user title, and assistant has a robot icon next to it, make the text appear in a rounded rectangle and visually distinctive for each of the roles, and add a hover over functionality when mouse is over a message to slightly pop it up to highlight it and show timestamp of the message under the message bubble"

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - Switch themes (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can toggle between light and dark themes at any time so that the interface is comfortable in different lighting conditions.

Why this priority: Theme choice is a foundational preference affecting readability and user comfort.

Independent Test: Starting in the default theme, activate the theme toggle and verify the entire UI switches theme consistently; toggle back and verify state resets.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given the app is open, When I click the theme toggle, Then the theme changes immediately and remains consistent across views.
2. Given the theme is dark, When I toggle again, Then the theme returns to light.

---

### User Story 2 - Show/hide left pane (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can hide or show the conversation list pane so I can focus on reading messages or switch threads when needed.

Why this priority: Controls content focus and space; essential for reading on smaller displays as well.

Independent Test: With the pane visible by default, activate the pane toggle to hide it; verify content area expands. Toggle again to show it.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given the left pane is visible, When I select "Hide pane", Then the pane is hidden and conversation view expands.
2. Given the left pane is hidden, When I select "Show pane", Then the pane is shown again in its previous position.

---

### User Story 3 - Mobile-optimized reading (Priority: P1)

As a mobile user, the conversation history should take most of the screen so the text is readable, while the chat list is quickly accessible when needed.

Why this priority: On small screens, maximizing reading area improves usability and reduces scrolling.

Independent Test: On a small viewport, verify the conversation view occupies the majority of the screen; verify the chat list can still be accessed via a clear control.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given a small-screen device, When I open the app, Then the conversation view uses the majority of horizontal space and the chat list is collapsed or overlaid on demand.
2. Given the chat list is collapsed on a small screen, When I activate the control for the chat list, Then the list appears and I can select a different conversation.

---

### User Story 4 - Distinct message bubbles by role (Priority: P1)

As a user, I can clearly distinguish my messages from the assistantâ€™s with alignment, icons, and bubble styling so I can follow the conversation at a glance.

Why this priority: Visual clarity of roles is core to reading and scanning the dialogue.

Independent Test: In a conversation with user and assistant messages, verify user messages are right-aligned with a human icon and assistant messages are left-aligned with a robot icon; verify bubbles have rounded corners and distinct visual treatments.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given a mixed conversation, When I view it, Then user messages display on the right with a human icon and assistant messages display on the left with a robot icon.
2. Given long messages, When I scroll, Then bubble styling remains consistent and readable without overlap or truncation.

---

### User Story 5 - Message hover and timestamp (Priority: P2)

As a desktop user, when I hover a message bubble, it subtly pops to indicate focus and reveals the message timestamp below the bubble so I can see when it was sent.

Why this priority: Adds helpful context without clutter; hover affordance is secondary to the core reading experience.

Independent Test: Hover a message with a pointing device; verify visual elevation and a timestamp appears below the bubble. On keyboard focus or tap (touch), verify an equivalent reveal.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given a pointer device, When I hover a message bubble, Then the bubble subtly elevates and the message timestamp appears beneath it.
2. Given keyboard navigation, When a message receives focus, Then the same timestamp is revealed without requiring hover.
3. Given a touch device, When I tap a message, Then the timestamp is revealed without requiring hover.

### Edge Cases

- Very long messages: bubbles wrap text gracefully without overlapping icons or controls.
- Mixed content (links, code, media): bubble styling remains consistent around content.
- Accessibility: color contrast meets guidelines; information is not conveyed by color alone; timestamp reveal is accessible via keyboard focus.
- Reduced motion: hover/focus effects respect reduced-motion preferences.
- Time zones/localization: timestamp formatting is human-readable regardless of locale.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: System MUST provide a theme toggle allowing users to switch between light and dark themes at any time.
- FR-002: System MUST default to a visible left pane on initial load and provide a control to hide/show it.
- FR-003: On small screens, System MUST prioritize the conversation view area and provide a clear control to access the chat list when needed.
- FR-004: Message display MUST visually differentiate roles: user messages right-aligned with a human indicator; assistant messages left-aligned with a robot indicator; both in rounded, readable bubbles with consistent spacing.
- FR-005: On hover with a pointing device, System MUST subtly elevate the message bubble and reveal its timestamp beneath; equivalent behavior MUST be available via keyboard focus and touch interaction.
- FR-006: System MUST meet basic accessibility expectations: keyboard operable controls, sufficient color contrast for themes, and no color-only distinctions.
- FR-007: Visual transitions MUST be performant and feel instantaneous to users (see Success Criteria for timing thresholds) and respect reduced-motion preferences.

### Key Entities

- Preference State: { theme: "light" | "dark" }
- Layout State: { leftPaneVisible: boolean, viewportCategory: "small" | "medium" | "large" }
- Message (UI): { role: "user" | "assistant", text, timestamp }

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

- SC-001: Users can locate and operate the theme toggle without assistance; at least 90% success rate in a basic usability check.
- SC-002: Theme changes apply within 100ms on a typical device and reflect across the entire interface.
- SC-003: On small screens, the conversation view occupies at least 60% of the primary viewport area by default.
- SC-004: 95% of test participants correctly identify message roles (user vs assistant) at a glance.
- SC-005: Hover/focus/tap reveals timestamps reliably, with reveal/hide transitions occurring within 150ms.
- SC-006: Color contrast for text and key UI elements meets commonly accepted accessibility guidelines.

## Assumptions

- Default theme is light on first load; user can toggle to dark and back during a session.
- Left pane visibility does not persist across sessions unless specified in a future enhancement.
- Small-screen behavior is determined by typical mobile viewport widths.
- Icons used to represent user and assistant are recognizable and non-branded.

## Dependencies & Constraints

- Must not degrade existing conversation rendering and navigation.
- Must remain fully client-side with no reliance on external services.
- Should not introduce regressions in keyboard navigation or screen reader announcements.

## Out of Scope

- Theme customization beyond light/dark (e.g., custom palettes).
- Persisting user preferences across sessions.
- Advanced timestamp customization (e.g., relative time vs absolute) beyond a simple human-readable format.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
