# Quickstart â€” Visual Themes Enhancements

This feature adds theme switching, a pane toggle, mobile-friendly layout, and role-distinct message bubbles with timestamp reveal.

## Try it

1) Theme toggle
- Use the theme toggle in the header to switch between light and dark.

2) Left pane toggle
- Use the pane toggle to hide/show the conversation list.

3) Mobile layout
- Resize the browser to a small width; the conversation view should dominate the screen with a control to access the chat list.

4) Message bubbles & timestamps
- Hover a bubble with a mouse (or focus via keyboard, or tap on touch) to slightly elevate it and display the timestamp below.

## Notes
- No persistence is included; toggles reset on refresh.
- Colors are chosen for sufficient contrast and readability; effects respect reduced-motion preferences.
