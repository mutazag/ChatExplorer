- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation summary (2025-10-28): Performed spec validation after adding the image pop-out user story. Detailed implementation examples were intentionally moved from `spec.md` to `implementation-notes.md` so the spec remains focused on WHAT/WHY. All checklist items were verified against the current spec and marked complete.

- If the team prefers stricter stakeholder-facing wording, minor wording edits can be made to remove remaining browser-specific phrasing in the Assumptions section (currently mentions HTML5 audio/video support). This was left to preserve clarity about supported environments.
