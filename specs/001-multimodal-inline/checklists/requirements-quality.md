## Requirement Completeness
- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements present for detecting and surfacing all supported media kinds (image, audio, video) within a message, including multiple items per message? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements FR-001/FR-002/FR-003]
- [ ] CHK002 Are fallback behaviors specified for unsupported media types (e.g., application/*) including link labeling and type disclosure? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK003 Are failure behaviors specified for media load errors (e.g., 404, blocked) with a visible but non‑intrusive message near the media? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases; Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK004 Are accessibility requirements defined for all media types (alt text for images; aria-label and controls for audio/video)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005; US3]
- [ ] CHK005 Are deterministic ordering requirements defined for rendering multiple media items within a message? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1/2; Plan §Summary]

- [ ] CHK007 Are normalization requirements documented for extracting media from multimodal parts into message.media[] with fields (kind, src/url, mime, alt, name)? [Completeness, Spec §Key Entities; Plan §Unknowns]
- [ ] CHK008 Are environment/browser support assumptions explicitly captured (Chrome/Edge latest on Windows) and tied to requirements where relevant? [Completeness, Spec §Assumptions]

## Requirement Clarity
- [ ] CHK009 Is “inline display” defined precisely (placement after Markdown body within the same message block)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001; Plan §Summary]
- [ ] CHK010 Are supported file types enumerated unambiguously (by MIME and/or extension) for images, audio, and video? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002/FR-003]
- [ ] CHK011 Is the fallback link specification explicit about displayed text (e.g., includes file name and type) and interaction (opens in new tab)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK012 Is the accessibility labeling requirement specific about defaulting behavior when alt/labels are missing (e.g., derive from filename vs generic)? [Clarity, Spec §US3 Acceptance; Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK013 Are URL safety rules explicitly stated (allowed schemes; disallowed javascript:, blob:; data: constraints)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006; Research/Security]
- [ ] CHK014 Are size constraints quantified (e.g., “max-width: 100%”, specific max-height values) rather than qualitative terms? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Consistency
- [ ] CHK015 Do Functional Requirements (FR-001..FR-008) align with User Stories 1–3 and Edge Cases with no contradictions (e.g., fallback vs inline priority)? [Consistency, Spec §FR; Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK016 Do Acceptance Scenarios under each User Story match the stated FRs (e.g., FR-004 ↔ unsupported types => download link)? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing; Spec §FR]
- [ ] CHK017 Do Assumptions (e.g., resolvable URLs, no external calls) align with Plan’s Technical Context and constraints? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions; Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK018 Do Key Entities’ field names/types match what FRs and tasks expect (e.g., url/src, mime, alt, name)? [Consistency, Spec §Key Entities; Tasks §Phase 3/4]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality (Measurability)
- [ ] CHK019 Are success criteria measurable with objective checks (e.g., SC-001..SC-004) and mapped to FRs/User Stories? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK020 Are accessibility criteria measurable (e.g., 100% media has alt/aria-label; presence of controls) with unambiguous thresholds? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK021 Are fallback/unsupported-type criteria measurable (e.g., 100% unsupported => labeled link)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK022 Are error-free operation criteria measurable (e.g., no console errors during normal playback) across target browsers? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-004; Assumptions]

## Scenario Coverage
- [ ] CHK023 Are Primary scenarios covered for each media type (single image; single audio; single video)? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1/2]
- [ ] CHK024 Are Alternate scenarios covered (multiple media items in one message; mixed media types) including order and layout? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK025 Are Exception/Error scenarios covered (unavailable media, blocked CORS, decoding errors) with specified user-visible outcome? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases; Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK026 Are Recovery/Degradation scenarios covered (fallback link when unsafe/unsupported or onerror)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-004; Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK027 Are Non-Functional scenarios covered (performance budget, responsiveness, no layout thrash)? [Coverage, Plan §Performance Goals]

## Edge Case Coverage
- [ ] CHK028 Is behavior defined for excessively large media (sizing constraints to avoid layout break)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases; Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK029 Is behavior defined for missing metadata (e.g., missing alt/mime/name) with defaults? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-005; Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK030 Is behavior defined for unrecognized file extensions but valid MIME or vice versa? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-002/FR-003]
- [ ] CHK031 Is ordering deterministic when parsing mapping/current_node yields multiple multimodal parts? [Edge Case, Spec §User Story 1; Plan §Summary]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] CHK032 Are explicit performance targets stated for render insertion and layout constraints (e.g., render in <16ms typical)? [NFR, Plan §Performance Goals]
- [ ] CHK033 Are accessibility conformance goals specified (e.g., WCAG AA basics) and tied to media requirements? [NFR, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK034 Are security requirements defined to prevent scriptable attributes, unsafe schemes, or event handler injection via media sources? [NFR/Security, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK035 Are responsive behavior requirements defined for small screens (320px) through desktop breakpoints? [NFR/UX, Tasks §Phase 6]

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- [ ] CHK036 Are normalization and asset resolution dependencies documented (e.g., mapping asset_pointer → URL; relative paths under data/export)? [Dependency, Plan §Unknowns; Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK037 Are browser capability assumptions (HTML5 audio/video support) validated or bounded in requirements (fallback when unsupported)? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions; Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK038 Are no-external-calls constraints explicit, with implications for thumbnails/transcoding clearly excluded? [Dependency/Scope, Plan §Constraints]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts
- [ ] CHK039 Is the defaulting strategy for alt and aria-labels unambiguous (e.g., derive from filename vs generic label) with precedence rules? [Ambiguity, Spec §US3 Acceptance]
- [ ] CHK040 Are safe URL scheme rules and exceptions (e.g., data: types allowed, blob: disallowed) explicitly codified without contradictions across docs? [Ambiguity/Conflict, Spec §FR-006; Research]
- [ ] CHK041 Is the exact visual placement and spacing of media relative to Markdown text defined (e.g., margins, grid vs stack) to avoid conflicting interpretations? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Story 1; Tasks §T011]
- [ ] CHK042 Is there an explicit statement on autoplay/muted/picture-in-picture behavior (if any) to avoid inconsistent defaults? [Ambiguity, Gap]

## Traceability & IDs
- [ ] CHK043 Do all Functional Requirements (FR-001..FR-008) map to at least one Success Criterion (SC-001..SC-004) and a testable scenario? [Traceability, Spec §FR ↔ §SC]
- [ ] CHK044 Is an ID scheme consistently used across spec/plan/tasks (FR, SC, US, T###) and cross-referenced where applicable? [Traceability, Spec/Plan/Tasks]
- [ ] CHK045 If any sections lack IDs, is there a requirement to add IDs for acceptance criteria and scenarios to maintain ≥80% traceability? [Traceability, Gap]
