# Tasks: Conversation detail renders Markdown messages

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-markdown-messages/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per constitution. Write tests FIRST for every function/module.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Minimal prep required by multiple stories

- [x] T001 Ensure test harness loads current UI and utils in `tests/index.html`
- [x] T002 [P] Add basic styles for Markdown content blocks in `styles.css` (headings spacing, list indentation, code block wrapping)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core renderer/sanitizer utilities; MUST complete before user stories

- [x] T003 Create Markdown utility module `renderMarkdownToSafeHtml(text)` in `src/utils/markdown.js`
- [x] T004 [P] Unit tests for Markdown utility (inline code, bold/italic, lists, headings) in `tests/conversation-browser/markdown.spec.js`
- [x] T005 [P] Wire detail renderer to accept HTML safely (scaffold) in `src/ui/detailView.js`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready â€” user story implementation can begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 â€” Readable rich text in detail (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Display basic Markdown (headings, lists, bold/italic, code blocks, links) so content is readable and structured.

**Independent Test**: With a message containing Markdown, verify `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<pre><code>`, `<ul>/<ol>`, and `<a>` elements render appropriately.

### Tests (MANDATORY â€” write first)

- [x] T006 [P] [US1] Detail view test: renders heading/bold/code/list/link in `tests/conversation-browser/detailView.spec.js`
- [x] T007 [P] [US1] Unit: fenced code block preserves whitespace in `tests/conversation-browser/markdown.spec.js`

### Implementation

- [x] T008 [US1] Implement headings/lists/inline code/bold/italic parsing in `src/utils/markdown.js`
- [x] T009 [US1] Implement fenced code block rendering `<pre><code>` in `src/utils/markdown.js`
- [x] T010 [US1] Render Markdown HTML in detail view after role label in `src/ui/detailView.js`
- [ ] T011 [US1] Verify tests pass locally via `tests/index.html`

**Checkpoint**: US1 independently delivers readable Markdown

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 â€” Safe links and sanitization (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Links work safely; app must not execute untrusted HTML or scripts.

**Independent Test**: Content with `<script>` and `javascript:` URLs does not create executable DOM; http(s) links open safely new-tab with rel set.

### Tests (MANDATORY â€” write first)

- [x] T012 [P] [US2] Detail view test: strip `<script>`, block `javascript:` links in `tests/conversation-browser/detailView.spec.js`
- [x] T013 [P] [US2] Unit: sanitizer allowlist and attribute stripping in `tests/conversation-browser/markdown.spec.js`

### Implementation

- [x] T014 [US2] Add allowlist sanitizer (P, BR, STRONG, EM, CODE, PRE, UL, OL, LI, A, H1â€“H6) in `src/utils/markdown.js`
- [x] T015 [US2] Link normalization: only http(s), mailto, #; set target and rel in `src/utils/markdown.js`
- [x] T016 [US2] Ensure detail view uses sanitized HTML only in `src/ui/detailView.js`
- [ ] T017 [US2] Verify tests pass locally via `tests/index.html`

**Checkpoint**: US2 independently guarantees safety of rendered content

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 â€” Plain text fallback and accessibility (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Plain text or malformed Markdown still renders as readable paragraphs; code blocks announced accessibly.

**Independent Test**: Plain text appears as paragraphs; `<pre>` has aria-label="code block".

### Tests (MANDATORY â€” write first)

- [x] T018 [P] [US3] Detail view test: plain text paragraphs and code block aria-label in `tests/conversation-browser/detailView.spec.js`
- [x] T019 [P] [US3] Unit: fallback to escaped paragraphs when parsing fails in `tests/conversation-browser/markdown.spec.js`

### Implementation

- [x] T020 [US3] Add paragraph grouping and line-break handling in `src/utils/markdown.js`
- [x] T021 [US3] Add aria-label="code block" to `<pre>` in `src/utils/markdown.js`
- [x] T022 [US3] Ensure empty/null text renders no body content in `src/ui/detailView.js`
- [ ] T023 [US3] Verify tests pass locally via `tests/index.html`

**Checkpoint**: US3 completes fallback and a11y behavior

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Finishing touches, performance, docs

- [x] T024 [P] Add ordered list edge-case tests (multi-digit numbering) in `tests/conversation-browser/markdown.spec.js`
- [ ] T025 Performance spot-check: large Markdown render <16ms per message (document results) in `specs/001-markdown-messages/quickstart.md`
- [x] T026 [P] Documentation updates in `specs/001-markdown-messages/quickstart.md`
- [ ] T027 Code cleanup and small refactors across `src/utils/markdown.js` and `src/ui/detailView.js`
 - [x] T028 [P] Add GFM pipe table support (parser + sanitizer tags) with tests in `tests/conversation-browser/markdown.spec.js`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- Setup (Phase 1): No dependencies
- Foundational (Phase 2): Depends on Setup; blocks user stories
- User Stories (Phase 3+): Depend on Foundational; can proceed independently in priority order
- Polish (Phase 6): After desired user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

- US1 (Markdown rendering): After Foundational
- US2 (Sanitization): After Foundational; independent of US1 but typically follows
- US3 (Fallback & a11y): After Foundational; independent; can run in parallel

### Parallel Opportunities

- [P] tasks in Setup and Foundational can run concurrently
- Within each User Story, [P] tests can be authored in parallel
- US2 and US3 can proceed in parallel after Foundational (different concerns)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1)

1. Complete Phase 1â€“2 (Setup + Foundational)
2. Complete Phase 3 (US1: Markdown rendering)
3. Stop and validate US1 independently

### Incremental Delivery

1. Add US2 (sanitization) and validate independently

2. Add US3 (fallback & a11y) and validate independently

3. Polish and cross-cutting improvements

---

## Summary & Validation

- Total tasks: 27
- Tasks per user story: US1 (6), US2 (6), US3 (6)
- Parallel opportunities: Marked with [P] across Setup, Foundational, and tests within each story
- Independent test criteria: Stated at the top of each user story section
- MVP scope: User Story 1 (basic Markdown rendering)
- Format validation: All tasks follow `- [ ] T### [P?] [US?] Description with file path`
