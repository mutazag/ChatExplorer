# Quickstart â€” Markdown messages

This feature renders message content as sanitized Markdown in the detail view.

## Run tests

- Open `tests/index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge on Windows)
- Verify the Markdown tests under `tests/conversation-browser/detailView.spec.js` pass

## Notes

- Rendering uses a minimal Markdown parser and allowlist sanitizer
- Only http(s), mailto, and # links are enabled; http(s) links open in a new tab with safe rel
- Code blocks receive aria-label="code block" for accessibility
