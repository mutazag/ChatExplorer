# Checklist: Requirements Quality — Markdown Messages

Purpose: Unit-test the quality of the written requirements for the "Markdown Messages" feature. This checklist verifies that the spec is complete, clear, consistent, measurable, and traceable for reviewers during PR review. Each item inspects the *requirements text* (not implementation).

Created: 2025-10-28
Feature: `001-markdown-messages` — specs/001-markdown-messages/spec.md

Note: This run creates a new checklist file. Each item below follows the pattern: - [ ] CHK### - <question> [QualityDimension, Spec §X]

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are all functional requirements for auto-linking and Markdown rendering explicitly stated (detection, preservation of authored markdown links, sanitizer integration)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-007]
- [ ] CHK002 - Is the scope of auto-linking clearly bounded (which schemes to auto-link, exclusions such as code spans/blocks)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, FR-004]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are acceptance scenarios for common flows listed (single URL, multiple URLs, markdown link preservation, unsafe schemes)? [Completeness, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 - Is the term "sanitize" defined with sufficient precision (which tags and attributes are allowed vs disallowed)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK005 - Is the expected visual handling of long URLs specified (truncate with ellipses + full URL in title/aria-label)? [Clarity, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK006 - Is the expected behavior when Markdown parsing fails documented (escaped text vs placeholder)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 - Are link attribute requirements consistent throughout the spec (every auto-created anchor MUST include `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"`)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK008 - Do code-block / inline-code rules align between the Markdown rendering section and the auto-linking rules (i.e., code spans must never be auto-linked)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality (Measurability)

- [ ] CHK009 - Are success criteria measurable and actionable (SC-001..SC-004 are specific enough to create automated tests)? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK010 - Is the performance target for rendering clarified and testable (the spec mentions both 16ms and 200ms — reconcile or mark as [Gap])? [Measurability, Spec §FR-008, SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 - Are the Primary / Alternate / Exception / Recovery scenario classes present and described (normal render, code-blocks, malformed URLs, sanitizer-stripped content)? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are internationalized domain names (IDN) and punycode handling specified or acknowledged as out-of-scope? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 - Is the behavior defined for data: / blob: / mailto: URLs (which are allowed by media rules, which are blocked)? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK014 - Are malformed or partial URLs explicitly handled (should not produce anchors)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements (Security / Accessibility / Performance)

- [ ] CHK015 - Are accessibility requirements specified for anchors and code blocks (aria-labels/title for truncated URLs, `<pre>` aria-label="code block", keyboard focus behavior)? [Accessibility, Spec §NFR-002, FR-006]
- [ ] CHK016 - Is the allowlist of permitted URL schemes for anchors explicitly enumerated (http(s), mailto, # fragments) and is handling of others documented? [Security, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK017 - Is the performance measurement methodology and test environment defined so SC-004 is reproducible? [Performance, Spec §FR-008, Spec §SC-004]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK018 - Is the assumption that `renderMarkdownToSafeHtml` exists and is the canonical sanitizer documented and traced to the implementation tasks? [Assumption, Spec §Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK019 - Is the decision-making rationale recorded for choosing a regex-based autolinker vs a vendored library (research/maintainability/security trade-offs)? [Dependency, research.md]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK020 - Are any conflicting requirements surfaced (for example, the conflicting performance targets 16ms vs 200ms)? [Conflict, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK021 - Is the fallback UX defined when sanitization removes links or markup (plain escaped text, visual hint, or placeholder)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-004]

## Traceability & Testability

- [ ] CHK022 - Do high-risk items (security, accessibility, performance) reference at least one corresponding test/task (tests in `tests/` and tasks in `specs/001-markdown-messages/tasks.md`)? [Traceability, tasks.md]
- [ ] CHK023 - Is there an ID scheme for requirements and acceptance criteria that maps to test cases and tasks (e.g., FR-### → test ID)? [Traceability, Gap]

## Final Sanity

- [ ] CHK024 - Is there a clear PR/merge gating rule documented for this feature (who signs off on sanitizer/security changes)? [Governance, Gap]

## Notes

- Run validation and mark pass/fail for each checklist item. If some items fail, update the spec and re-run validation.
