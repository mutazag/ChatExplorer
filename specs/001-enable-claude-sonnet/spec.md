# Feature Specification: Enable Claude Sonnet 4.5 for All Clients

**Feature Branch**: `001-enable-claude-sonnet`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Enable Claude Sonnet 4.5 for all clients"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Platform-wide Availability Toggle (Priority: P1)

As an organization owner, I need the Claude Sonnet 4.5 model to be available for all client accounts so teams can use it without per-account enablement.

**Why this priority**: Delivers immediate access and reduces operational overhead by removing per-client enable steps.

**Independent Test**: Set global enablement ON in an isolated environment containing multiple client accounts; verify each client can access the model in their model selection UI or capabilities list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** global enablement is ON, **When** a client signs in, **Then** the client can access Claude Sonnet 4.5 without additional configuration
2. **Given** global enablement is OFF, **When** a client signs in, **Then** the client cannot access Claude Sonnet 4.5

### User Story 2 - Governance Controls and Safeguards (Priority: P2)

As a compliance administrator, I need auditability and safeguards around the enablement so that usage is controlled and changes are tracked for audits.

**Why this priority**: Ensures compliance, traceability, and safe rollout.

**Independent Test**: Enable/disable the model and verify an audit record is created; verify changes require appropriate permission level.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user lacks required permissions, **When** they attempt to change enablement, **Then** the action is blocked and logged
2. **Given** a change to enablement occurs, **When** an auditor reviews logs, **Then** there is a timestamped record including actor, scope, and state before/after

---

### User Story 3 - Rollout Safety and Messaging (Priority: P3)

As a support manager, I need a safe rollout mechanism with clear client-facing messaging so users understand the change and can self-serve basic questions.

**Why this priority**: Reduces support burden and mitigates rollout risk.

**Independent Test**: Configure staged rollout or notifications and verify clients receive appropriate messaging and that rollout can be paused or rolled back.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** rollout is staged, **When** phase N starts, **Then** only targeted clients gain access
2. **Given** a critical issue is detected, **When** rollback is initiated, **Then** access is removed and a message is shown to affected clients

---

### Edge Cases

- Conflicting policies at client-level (local disable) vs global enablement
- Model unavailable or degraded from provider; global enablement is ON
- License/seat limits reached for certain tenants
- Clients operating in restricted regions or industry with special compliance rules
- Migration overlap: existing custom allow-lists or deny-lists

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a global enablement control for Claude Sonnet 4.5 that applies to all client accounts
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce permission checks so only authorized roles can change enablement state
- **FR-003**: System MUST reflect enablement state in client-facing capabilities (e.g., model availability indicator)
- **FR-004**: System MUST log all enablement changes with timestamp, actor, previous state, new state, and scope
- **FR-005**: System MUST support rollback to previous state within 5 minutes without residual access
- **FR-006**: System MUST support staged rollout by client cohort or group
- **FR-007**: System MUST present clear explanatory messaging to clients upon enablement
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle provider outages gracefully and communicate availability status to clients
- **FR-009**: System MUST respect client-level exceptions when explicitly configured (local disable overrides global enable) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: precedence rules]
- **FR-010**: System MUST expose read-only status endpoints or views for auditors and support staff

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Enablement Policy**: Attributes: state (ON/OFF), scope (global, cohort), actor, timestamp, change-id, rationale
- **Client Account**: Attributes: account-id, cohort/group, local-policy (override), effective-model-access
- **Audit Record**: Attributes: change-id, actor, action, previous/new state, scope, timestamp

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of eligible clients see Claude Sonnet 4.5 as available within 10 minutes of enablement
- **SC-002**: 0 unauthorized enablement changes (all attempts blocked and logged)
- **SC-003**: 95% of enablement/disablement changes are fully propagated within 5 minutes
- **SC-004**: <2% of clients require support assistance during rollout (measured over first 14 days)
- **SC-005**: 100% of enablement changes produce audit records containing actor, timestamp, scope, and state change
- **SC-006**: Rollback completes within 5 minutes and removes access for 100% of clients in scope

## Assumptions

- "Clients" refers to tenant/customer accounts in a multi-tenant environment [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm definition of clients]
- Enablement is a policy/configuration change, not per-user subscription
- Local client overrides (deny) must be respected if explicitly set [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm precedence]
- Messaging will be provided via existing client-facing notification channels [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm channels]
