# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., JavaScript ES6+, HTML5 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., None (vanilla), Mocha (testing only) or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [e.g., Local JSON files, Browser File API, Static HTML or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Testing**: [e.g., Mocha (browser), Jest (Node.js for unit tests) or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., client-side web application - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [e.g., <100ms file parsing, smooth 60fps UI or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [e.g., No build step, offline-capable, no external API calls or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [e.g., Support ChatGPT exports up to 10MB, 1000s of conversations or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Client-Side Only**: Feature uses ONLY HTML + vanilla JavaScript, no backend/server components?
- [ ] **No Database Integration**: Feature reads from local files only, no database connections?
- [ ] **Minimal Dependencies**: Feature avoids frameworks/libraries OR justifies in complexity table?
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: All functions and modules will have tests written BEFORE implementation?
- [ ] **File-Based Data**: Feature reads from static files (JSON/HTML) with documented format?
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**: Feature uses standard Web APIs compatible with modern browsers?
- [ ] **UI & Branding**: UI is responsive (320px–desktop) and includes the MagTech.ai logo from local assets?

**Result**: ✅ PASS | ⚠️ VIOLATIONS REQUIRE JUSTIFICATION IN COMPLEXITY TABLE

**Structure Decision**: Client-side application with modular JavaScript organization.
All code runs in browser; no backend services.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
